You can do this in a variety of ways:

# How does it work?
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

â€¢ Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate by adding the â€˜hacktoberfestâ€™ topic.

â€¢ Quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded.

â€¢ Engaged maintenance of Hacktoberfest tagged repositories are rewarded.

# What are the Rules? 
Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest.

â€¢ You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

â€¢ The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.

â€¢ If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.

â€¢ If a maintainer reports behavior thatâ€™s not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

â€¢ A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.
